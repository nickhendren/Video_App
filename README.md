# MediaHub

MediaHub is a website that allows users to post and link to their favorite Youtube videos and Gifs from around the internet. Users who signup for the website are allowed to post comments on the videos/gifs that have been previously posted. MediaHub was developed with Ruby on Rails and stylized by utiilizing Bootstrap.

MediaHub also utilizes the gem BCrypt for user authentication as well as Bootstrap Form (https://github.com/bootstrap-ruby/rails-bootstrap-forms) to easily make Bootstrap-styled forms within Ruby html.erb tags.
